# Machine Learning with Python

In this workshop we'll create a Supervised Learning example, predict if a person
is likely to develop diabetes.

#Asking the right question?

After all, don't we already know that we want to predict? If a person will develop
diabetes?

We need a question that show us the direction of the data we gather, how we mold the data, how we interpret the solution,
and the criteria we use to validate the solution. What we need is more than one line question.

Our statement should to include:

1. Define scope (including data sources)
2. Define target performance
3. Determine context for usage
4. Define how solution will be created

## Scope and data sources

Our initial statement is:

> Predict if a person will develop diabetes

Our statement should include the scope of our exercise, so here is very important to define the data sources
that we'll use to predict if a person will develop diabetes. The Pima Indian Diabetes study is a good source, this study conducted in the 90's about diabetes is in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, one of the best sources to get data for ML exercises.
So now, our statement will look like this:

> Using Pima Indian Diabetes data, predict which people will develop diabetes
